# Using Maps

## Structure

- Add the code necessary to the `App` class found in the `starter` project `UsingMaps`.
- All methods should be `public`.
- Tests can be found in the `test/java` directory. Once you have written each class, uncomment the code in the
  associated test and run it.

## Requirements

1. Create a method called `printKeys` which takes in a `Map` with String keys and String values and iterates through and
   prints out all keys in the `Map`.
2. Create a method called `printValues` which takes in a `Map` with String keys and String values and iterates through
   and prints out all values in the `Map`.
3. Create a method called `printKeysAndValues` which takes in a `Map` with String keys and String values iterates
   through the Entry Set of the `Map` and print both the keys and values in the `Map` in this format: `key: value`.
4. Create a method called `mapFun` which does the following:
    1. Takes in a `Map` with String keys and integer values
    2. Returns a `Map` with String keys and integer values
    3. Assume the `Map` will always contain at least these entries:

       |       Key       |       Value       |
               |-----------------|-------------------|
       | Toyota Camry    |       2012        |
       | Chevy Camaro    |       1969        |
       | Hyundai Genesis |       2015        |
       | Jeep Wrangler   |       2003        |
       | Honda Civic     |       2018        |
       | Toyota Supra    |       1995        |
       | Pontiac GTO     |       1964        |

    4. Add two new entries to the `Map` - a 2012 Ford Explorer and a 2013 Smart Fortwo.
    5. Remove the Jeep Wrangler from the `Map`.
    6. Return the `Map`.
5. Create a method called `listCars` which takes in a `List` of `Car` objects and complete the following:
    1. Create a `List` called `toyotaList` to hold all the `Car` variables with "Toyota" as the make and add them to the
       List.
    2. Create a `List` called `fordList` to hold all the `Car` variables with "Ford" as the make and add them to the
       List.
    3. Create a `List` called `hondaList` to hold all the `Car` variables with "Honda" as the make and add them to the
       List.
    4. Store all 3 `List` in a `Map` with the make as the key.
    5. Return the `Map`.

**Hint:** Your key will be a `String`. What will your value be?
