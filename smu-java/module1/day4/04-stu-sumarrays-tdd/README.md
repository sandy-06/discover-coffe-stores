# SumArrays TDD

## Instructions

* Create a new project call SumArrays.
* Work in pairs to complete all of the following goals.

### Goals

- Add failing tests for a sumArrays method. sumArrays should take two arrays and sum all the numbers in both arrays. For example, `sumArrays([2,3],[1,5,5])` should return 16.
- Add a failing test for arrayify. arrayify should take in two integers. It should create an array of the length of the first integer that contains consecutive integers starting at the second integer. For example, arrayify(3,5) returns [5,6,7].
- Once you have failing tests with a sufficient number of equivalence classes, write code to pass the tests.

**Hint**: You'll need to use `assertArrayEquals` to compare arrays.
