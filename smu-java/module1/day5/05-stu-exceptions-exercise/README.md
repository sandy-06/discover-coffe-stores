# Exception Exercise

## Structure

- Add the code necessary to the `Application` class found in the `starter` project `ExceptionExercise`.
- Tests can be found in the `test/java` directory.

## Requirements

Handle the following exceptions:

1. When a user enters a non-integer value, display "Please enter a valid number."
2. When a user chooses a value not present in the array, display "Please choose an available pet."
3. If the file does not exist, display the message "The following file does not seem to exist:" along with the output from the Exception `.getMessage()`.
4. If there was trouble writing the file, display "Something went wrong while writing your file."
5. Regardless of success or exceptions, tell the user to "Have a nice day!"

**Note** The test will delete `pets.txt`, so you may need to recreate it in the root of your project directory.
