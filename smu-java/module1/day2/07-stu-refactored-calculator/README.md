# Refactored Calculator

## Introduction

We refactor code to make it more efficient and maintainable. This process reduces technical cost and streamlines the QA and debugging process.

## Requirements

- Use the code from the "starter" directory.
- You must test the refactored calculator test using `CalculatorTest`.

## Instructions

1. Refactor your simple calculator application to overload each method to handle each of the following input types:

    - `int`

    - `long`

    - `float`

    - `double`

2. Once you have the `Calculator` class refactored, test using `CalculatorTest`.
