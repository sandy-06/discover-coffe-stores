# Student Class

Using the Person Class activity as a guide, create a new `Student` class.

1. Create a new Maven based IntelliJ project called `StudentClass`
   1. Make sure your `StudentClass` is in the `com.company` package
2. This class should have a `String` property called `name` and a `double` property called `gpa`.
3. This class should have `setName()` and `setGpa()` methods that allow you to set a value for your properties.
4. This class should have a method called `greet()`.
   - When `greet()` is called, it should print `"Hello, I am <NAME> and I have a <GPA> GPA."`
5. Once you have your `Student` class created, create a new class called `App`, which has a `main()` method.
   - Make sure your `App` class is in the `com.company` package
   - In that `main()` method, create two new `Student` objects, set their `name` and `gpa`, and then call the `greet()` method on each.
